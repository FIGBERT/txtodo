# txtodo

pronounced "text to do," **txtodo** is a minimalist open-source todo list app
made by [figbert][figbert] and inspired by [jeff huang][jeff]. it lists your
immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things done without overthinking it.
plus, it's lightweight, open-source, and built with swiftui.

after reading a [post][post] by jeff huang on [hacker news][hn], i started
thinking about how i managed my own daily tasks. i wanted to make a solution
that could train me into being highly productive.
