# txtodo

Pronounced "text to do," **txtodo** is a simple and minimalist open-source todo app made by [FIGBERT][0] and based on Jeff Huang's post, [*My productivity app for the past 12 years has been a single .txt file*][1].

After stumbling on his [post][3] through [Hacker News][4], where it managed to hit #1 on [February 8th][5], I started thnking about how I managed my own productivity. For the past few months, I've been jumping from app to app looking for a way to force myself into be productive.

I started with [TickTick][6] – which I saw recommended in an [MKBHD video][7] – moved to my iPhone's native [Reminders][8] after some security concerns, went without a tool for a while, and ended up relying on a number of [trello][9] [kanban][10] boards to manage all of my projects.

After reading [Jeff's article][1], however, I deleted all my other apps and set to work. The system that he outlines is a little too hard core for me, but I figure that I could make a solution that could become my daily driver.

That solution is **txtodo**. It manages immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things done, while the floating tasks let you keep track of long term goals. Its simple, black-and-white UI is straightforward and easy on the eyes. Plus, it's entirely open source and all your data is encrypted securely.

Download it on the App Store and give it a try! ~~not yet though I'm still working on it~~
