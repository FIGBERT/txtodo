# txtodo

pronounced "text to do," **txtodo** is a minimalist open-source todo
list app made by [figbert] and inspired by [jeff huang]. it lists your
immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things done without
overthinking it. plus, it's lightweight, open-source, and built with
swiftui.

after reading a [post] by jeff huang on [hacker news], i started
thinking about how i managed my own daily tasks. i wanted to make a
solution that could train me to be highly productive.

that solution is **txtodo**. it manages immediate, short-term tasks to
help you get things done. welcome to productivity. welcome to txtodo.
