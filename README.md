# txtodo

Pronounced "text to do," **txtodo** is a simple, minimalist open-source todo app made by [FIGBERT][0] and inspired by [Jeff Huang][1].

After stumbling on his [post][2] through [Hacker News][3], where it managed to hit #1 on [February 8th][4], I started thinking about how I managed my own productivity. For the past few months, I've been jumping from app to app looking for a way to force myself into be productive. The system Jeff outlines is a little too hard core for me, but I figured that I could make an app to do something similar.

Welcome to **txtodo**. It manages immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things done without overthinking them. Plus, it's entirely open source, and built with SwiftUI.

Download it on the App Store and give it a try! ~~not yet though I'm still working on it~~
