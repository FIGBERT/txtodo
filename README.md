# txtodo

pronounced "text to do," **txtodo** is a minimalist open-source todo list app made by [figbert][0] and inspired by [jeff huang][1]. it lists your immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things done without overthinking it. plus, it's lightweight, open-source, and built with swiftui.

after reading a [post][2] by jeff huang on [hacker news][3], i started thinking about how i managed my own daily tasks. i wanted to make a solution that could train me into being highly productive.

that solution is **txtodo**. it manages immediate, short-term tasks to help you get things done. welcome to productivity. welcome to txtodo.
